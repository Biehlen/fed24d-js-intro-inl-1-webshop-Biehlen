# Webshop - Munkfabriken - JavaScript</h1>

This is a JavaScript schoolproject where we had to make an online store.
The title of my projekt is called Munkfabriken (The donutfactory). 

We got a short breef and some guidelines of what our prodject had to contain. For example:
x The project has to be a "one pager", it had to be responsive and it hade to work on mobile, tablet and desktop.  
x There had to be a minimum of 10 different products.
x You had to be able to sort the products by name, price, rating and category. 
x There had to be a cart where only ordered products would show. 
x The total sum of all products in cart had to change if more products where added or deleted. 
x To be able to click on the order button in the end, all input fields has to be filled in correctly.  

There were aslo a bunch of specialrules that we had to add. For example: 
x On mondays before 10 o'clock a 10% discount would be added in the cart automaticly and a message explaining this should be added. 
x If the customer has ordered products for more than 800kr the invoice payment option will no longer be avalible. 
x If the customer has ordered more than 15 products the shipping fee will be free and a 10% discount on the total sum will be added.
